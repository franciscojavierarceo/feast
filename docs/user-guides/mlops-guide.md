# Feast for MLOps Engineers

## What Feast Offers MLOps Teams
- Production feature serving with high availability
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Infrastructure management across multiple environments
- Multi-cloud deployment support (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Scalable online and offline store management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

## Infrastructure Setup

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install Feast with all dependencies
pip install "feast[aws,gcp,azure]"

# For production deployments
pip install "feast[redis,postgres,go]"  # Common production dependencies
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Docker Deployment
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  feast-online-serving:
    image: feastdev/feature-server
    ports:
      - "6566:6566"
    environment:
      - FEAST_CORE_URL=core:6565
      - FEAST_ONLINE_SERVING_PORT=6566
```

#### 2. Kubernetes Deployment
```yaml
# helm values.yaml
feast-feature-server:
  enabled: true
  image:
    repository: feastdev/feature-server
    tag: latest
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
    limits:
      memory: "2Gi"
      cpu: "1000m"
```

### Storage Configuration

#### Online Store Options
```yaml
# feature_store.yaml
project: my_project
registry: data/registry.db
provider: aws
online_store:
  type: redis
  connection_string: redis://localhost:6379/0
```

#### Offline Store Options
```yaml
offline_store:
  type: redshift
  region: us-west-2
  cluster_id: feast-cluster
  database: feast
  user: feast_user
  s3_staging_location: s3://feast-staging
```

## Operations Guide

### 1. Deployment Patterns

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- Deploy new feature server alongside existing one
- Validate new deployment
- Switch traffic gradually using load balancer
- Monitor for errors before full cutover

#### Canary Releases
- Deploy to subset of users/traffic
- Monitor key metrics
- Gradually increase traffic
- Automated rollback on error thresholds

### 2. Monitoring

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Feature freshness
- Feature server latency
- Request success rate
- Storage backend performance
- Resource utilization

#### Monitoring Setup
```python
from feast import FeatureStore
from feast.infra.online_stores.monitoring import OnlineStoreMonitoring

# Configure monitoring
monitoring = OnlineStoreMonitoring(
    prometheus_port=8000,
    monitoring_interval_seconds=60
)

# Example Prometheus metrics
feature_freshness_gauge = Gauge(
    'feast_feature_freshness_seconds',
    'Time since last feature update'
)
```

### 3. Scaling Strategies

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Use Kubernetes HPA for automatic scaling
- Configure resource limits and requests
- Set up proper monitoring thresholds

```yaml
# kubernetes/hpa.yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: feast-feature-server
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: feast-feature-server
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

#### Vertical Scaling
- Monitor resource usage patterns
- Adjust resource limits based on workload
- Consider cost optimization

### 4. Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues
1. Feature freshness delays
   - Check materialization jobs
   - Verify offline store connectivity
   - Monitor transformation pipeline

2. High latency
   - Check online store performance
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review resource utilization

3. Failed deployments
   - Verify configuration
   - Check dependencies
   - Review deployment logs

## Best Practices
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Use infrastructure as code
- Maintain separate environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Performance testing before production deployment
