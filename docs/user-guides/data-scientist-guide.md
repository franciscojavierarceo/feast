# Feast for Data Scientists and ML Engineers

## What Feast Offers Data Scientists
- Feature definition and discovery
- Point-in-time correct training datasets
- Consistent feature access for training and serving
- Python-first interface

## Quick Start for Data Scientists
### Installation
```python
pip install feast
```

### Define Features
```python
from feast import FeatureStore, Entity, Feature, FeatureView, ValueType
from datetime import timedelta

# Define an entity
driver = Entity(
    name="driver_id",
    value_type=ValueType.INT64,
    description="Driver ID"
)

# Create a feature view
driver_stats_view = FeatureView(
    name="driver_stats",
    entities=["driver_id"],
    ttl=timedelta(days=1),
    features=[
        Feature(name="avg_daily_trips", dtype=ValueType.FLOAT),
        Feature(name="completion_rate", dtype=ValueType.FLOAT),
    ],
)
```

### Create Training Dataset
```python
# Get historical features for training
training_df = store.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features=[
        "driver_stats:avg_daily_trips",
        "driver_stats:completion_rate",
    ],
).to_df()
```

### Access Online Features
```python
# Get online features for prediction
features = store.get_online_features(
    features=[
        "driver_stats:avg_daily_trips",
        "driver_stats:completion_rate"
    ],
    entity_rows=[{"driver_id": 1001}]
).to_dict()
```

## Common Workflows
1. Define new features
   - Create feature views
   - Define transformations
   - Register features with Feast

2. Create training datasets
   - Generate point-in-time correct training data
   - Join multiple feature views
   - Export datasets for model training

3. Access online features
   - Deploy features to online store
   - Retrieve features for real-time inference
   - Monitor feature serving performance

## Best Practices
- Use consistent naming conventions for features
- Document feature definitions and transformations
- Test feature pipelines before deployment
- Monitor feature freshness and quality
- Version control your feature definitions
